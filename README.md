# Environmental Justice: Using Machine Learning Models to Classify Communities with High Rates of Asthma

Our  project  trains  four  machine  learning  models to classify communities who face high rates of asthma.  We are more interested in determining  which features are correlated with higher rates of asthma rather than accuracy.

When running the code files, please first look at the file named "Final Project.ipynb' and then only view 'Final Project with 2 labels.ipynb'. There is only one difference in these two files which is marked by a header. The second file only uses two labels to classify the data which results in different outcomes for the models.
