# Environmental Justice: Using Machine Learning Models to Classify Communities with High Rates of Asthma

Our  project  trains  four  machine  learning  models to classify communities who face high rates of asthma.  We are more interested in determining  which features are correlated with higher rates of asthma rather than accuracy.

When running the code files, please first look at the file named "Final Project.ipynb' and then only view 'Final Project with 2 labels.ipynb'. There is only one difference in these two files which is marked by a header. The second file only uses two labels to classify the data which results in different outcomes for the models.

## Instructions for how to use this repo

----------
Welcome! This is your shared repository for you and your group members for the
Final Project.  The directory structure will help make the deliverables clear and
centralize your submission.  Following the structure and keeping your repo
up-to-date is important for us to able to effectively advise you.  You may add
additional structure, but please be sure to use the existing elements as
defined here:

## Planning
Upload your proposal pdf in the [planning](planning/) directory.  Use the
[README](planning/README.md) in that directory to define, and update your
timeline. Each week, you will provide a summary of progress by **Sunday at
5pm**.  For each week, define:
* What goals/tasks you accomplished from the previous week
* What goals you did not accomplish (and an explanation of the road block)
* Any items you need assistance with

## Final Paper

In the [paper/](paper) directory, you will find the template for your final
project paper.  *You must use the provided template* for your final paper.  If
you would like to use [OverLeaf](http://www.overleaf.com) or other IDE, please
upload my provided files to ensure consistency.  We must be able to compile
your TeX files, so be sure to include all source material (including images) in
your final submission, and please test compilation on the CS lab machines (the
included Makefile should simplify this process).

## Final Presentation

In the [presentation/](presentation) directory, place all files related to your
project presentations.  If you use GoogleDocs, you can share the document with
the instructors by email, but please also download the slides here as a PDF.

## Data

**DO NOT COMMIT LARGE DATA FILES TO YOUR REPO**.  Please discuss with us first
efficient ways to manage your data sets.  We will send instructions on how to
submit your project data that is needed to replicate your results.
