Welcome! Include all code you have used for your project here.
Please place information on how to run your code in this README file.  
Include a short description about the purpose and use of each file.


We have two note books. The main difference between the two is that Final Project.ipynb had four labels and Final Project-NewData.ipynb had two labels. Both of them have almost the same code otherwise. We commented the first file before we copied the code for the -NewData file so we would advise to go through that first.

We did our project by first making a dataset. Then for the chosen models, we first performed Gridsearch for as many hyperparameters the computer could process. For each model, we also plotted validation curves to figure out for one most important parameter each. We then plotted feature importance graphs.
